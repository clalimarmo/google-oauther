# google-oauther

Simple Google OAuth2 module, for use in single page, client-side only
applications.  It opens a popup window to request permission, and stores the
auth token returned by Google.

## Usage

    var authenticator = require('google-oauther');

    authenticator.onAuthenticate(function(auth) {
      //stuff to do once the authenticator has authenticated user's profile info
      //(The auth parameter passed to the callback the authenticator, itself)
    });

    authenticator.run({
      scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write'],
      clientID: 'your-google-oauth2-client-id'
    });

## Methods

### onAuthenticate

Specify behavior that should occur once the user grants the requested
permissions. Do this before you call `run`

### run

Requests authentication from the user, and whatever permissions you specify
with the `scope` parameter.

### user

Returns the user profile information gleaned from an authenticated request to
https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me

### token

Returns the auth token. Useful for subsequent requests to other Google APIs.

### reauthenticate

Does the same thing as run.

### tokenIsExpired

Indicates whether the token is expired or not.

## Notes

The authenticator always requests the 'profile' OAuth2 scope, in addition to
whatever scopes are specified in the call to `run`.

For the popup window to send the auth token returned by google back to the main
window, a global callback function is attached to the main window, called
`authenticatedWith`. Including the `google-oauther` module will attach this
callback function automatically; overwriting this function will break the
authenticator.
